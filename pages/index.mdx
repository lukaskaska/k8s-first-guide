# Kubernetes starting guide
 
Welcome to the introductory Kubernetes course for developers. Our goal is to create a step-by-step guide that facilitates the adaptation to this new environment.

Each page will guide you through a Kubernetes feature, providing a brief explanation of the concepts, followed by examples that can be replicated on your machine.

## Requirements

Next, the list of all the packages that need to be installed beforehand:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## Let's start!
